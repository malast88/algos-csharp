# algos-csharp
Collection of algorithms I've observed during solving puzzles on Hackerrank etc.
Just a place where I save some pieces of code which I've used while solving puzzles.
Please do no treat this as claim for bragging, I use it just as my personal toolbox and to track my progress (to ensure that I really could understand this codes).
